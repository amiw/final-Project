#Interactive wall

The interactive wall is a relationship between hands and lights through the screen. The input is the hand sensor. Depending on the different distance of the hand from the hand sensor (z dimension)  , the led strip will have different color scheme. The screen is embedded with LED strip and connects through a hand sensor.  In bigger scale, the the screen could be a facade that track people passing through a threshold. As one person pass by the LED strip will blink up one tile (one LED light). Eventually all the LED light blink, the screen will restart tracking people again. 
eventually, I learned that BlinkyTape LED didn't work because I cut off the data board from the tape.
