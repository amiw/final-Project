#Interactive wall

The interactive wall is a relationship between hands and lights through the screen. The input is the hand sensor. Depending on the different distance of the hand from the hand sensor (z dimension)  , the led strip will have different color scheme. The screen is embedded with LED strip and connects through a hand sensor.
